Setting up Junit :

In this Exercise we are asked to setup Junit and add a test class to run and verify.

Firstly we created a Maven Project and then added the Junit dependency in the pom.xml file.

Now We create a test file and a main class file to add some conditions that can be tested using Junit.

We will get the green tick if all the test cases are passed along with the number of tests passed and will show wrong if any of it fails.
