Arrange-Act-Assert Pattern in Junit :

In this Exercise we are asked to organize the tests using the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern and use setup and teardown methods.

Firstly we created a Maven Project and then added the Junit dependency in the pom.xml file.

Now We create a test file to add the conditions that are to be checked and run it using the Junit and check the Output.

We will get the green tick if all the test cases are passed and will show wrong if any of it fails.

Output :

Setting up before test

Tearing down after test

Setting up before test

Tearing down after test

Process finished with exit code 0
