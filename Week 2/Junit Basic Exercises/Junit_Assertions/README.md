Assertions in Junit :

In this Exercise we are asked to run some test case and verify that are true using Junit testing.

Firstly we created a Maven Project and then added the Junit dependency in the pom.xml file.

Now We create a test file to add the conditions that are to be checked and run it using the Junit and check the Output.

It will show the green tick if all the test cases are passed and will show wrong if any of it fails.

We got green tick which means all the cases are correct and passed without any error.
