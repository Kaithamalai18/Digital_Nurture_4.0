Mockito Verifying Interactions :


In this Exercise we see how to verify a specific method on a mock object was called using Mockito. 

This is useful for testing the behavior and interaction between components, rather than just output.

We first added dependencies of Junit and Mockito.

Then we create the required Service, Api and Testing files and added the code to test it using Mockito.
