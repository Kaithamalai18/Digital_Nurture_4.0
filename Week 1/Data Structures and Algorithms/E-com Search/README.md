- Linear Search: Checks each item one by one
- Binary Search: Efficient but needs sorted data

Linear Search is Preferable if the dataset is small and Binary Search is usable for larger dataset.

As E-com can have larger dataset, Binary Search is the better choice for an e-commerce platform when you're dealing with large, sorted datasets â€” because it's faster, more scalable, and gives a smoother user experience.
